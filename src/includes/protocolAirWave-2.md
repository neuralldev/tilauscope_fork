### Version 1.0.1 (October 8, 2025)

**New Features:**

> **Note**: The following features are primarily designed for OmniFlux integration, but any third-party device can implement these protocols to simulate OmniFlux functionality.

1. **Device Settings - Host Name Request (Cmd 1)**
   - Added Device Ask Host Name protocol
   - Device can request host name from connected device
   - OmniFlux integration: If host name starts with "OmniFlux", AirWave recognizes connection to OmniFlux roaster
   - Third-party devices can also use host names starting with "OmniFlux" to enable integration features

2. **Device Action - Baking Stage (Cmd 4)**
   - Added baking stage reading protocol
   - Device continuously reads baking stage from OmniFlux host
   - Supported stages: Wait, In Bean, Turn Yellow, First Blast, Second Blast, Cool
   - Third-party devices can implement this protocol to provide baking stage information

3. **Device Action - Control Mode (Cmd 5)**
   - Added control mode switching protocol
   - Host can set AirWave to Auto or Manual mode
   - Response indicates current mode (success/failure of mode switch)
   - **Important**: Auto mode is only available when connected to OmniFlux (or devices simulating OmniFlux). The device must send a host name starting with "OmniFlux" to enable auto mode switching.
   - Requires firmware version V005 or higher

**Integration Workflow:**

1. **Connection**: AirWave connects to host device via Bluetooth
2. **Host Name Request**: AirWave requests host name (Cmd 1)
3. **OmniFlux Recognition**: If host name starts with "OmniFlux", AirWave recognizes it as OmniFlux
4. **Mode Switching**: Host can switch AirWave to Auto mode (Cmd 5)
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: In Auto mode, AirWave continuously reads baking stage from host (Cmd 4)
